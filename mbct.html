            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Alberta Mindfulness Association is a global partner with Oxford University’s Mindfulness Centre (OMC). In collaboration with the Alberta Government, we are presently providing associates of various institutes and organizations with the opportunity to attend licensed Mindfulness training courses and receive certification. By attending these courses, students that become future educators and facilitators with MBCT training will be able to teach to public and private institutions. Oxford will be exclusively teaching Alberta residents MBCT courses with their 1-year program; with Alberta Mind Association acting as moderator to screen for befitting individuals to attend the program. All considered candidates will be required to undergo rigorous screening, background and financial checks, interviews etc. to maintain quality and integrity of Oxford University and their MBCT courses.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                We are currently working alongside Oxford University to provide the 8-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program. This program is a form of therapy that is most commonly used to treat chronic depression, but it is also appropriate for anyone seeking relief for a wide-range of overwhelming negative emotions and concerns. Its primary aim is to relieve negative emotional and physical symptoms to change internal thought processes. Mindfulness gives you the ability to step back from negative beliefs and emotions that are released through breathing, scanning and meditation exercises, then challenge and question personal thoughts and beliefs to be completely true. It teaches practitioners perception change and in turn, change how you react in a healthy way.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                These MBCT courses will be taught by a licensed and professionally trained Oxford therapist. During sessions, practitioners will learn meditative, body and breathing techniques. Mindfulness practice is recommended daily during the program to instill mindful attitude even when there are no sessions.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Practitioners can expect changes right away following the first session, as many tend to notice how active their minds are and how it constantly fights overthinking about past situations and future events. They are encouraged to realize that mindfulness will take time to learn and require patience and persistence, with the internal challenge of questioning your negative assumptions and beliefs. The reason why MBCT is beneficial, is that it forces one to highlight the overarching prevalence of Automatic Negative Thoughts (ANTs). This singular act of noticing the amount and frequency of negative thought is what pulls practitioners into daily practice.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The use of MBCT changes mental mindset that inadvertently affects your physical well-being. With higher rates of motivation and life satisfaction, practitioners report healthier relationships, lifestyle and attitude just by getting out of their head and more connected with their environment.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Following the implementation of general introduction MBCT courses, interested individuals can apply for the Oxford Mindfulness 12-month teach training programme. This online training can provide a long-term platform for individuals that wish to continue their education and skillset. Upon completion of this program, successful students will be eligible to apply with ACCESSMBCT upon completion. This internationally recognized database is an accredited institution suitable for clinicians and those aiming to teach in a non-clinical environment, as graduates will be able to teach various MBCT curricula post-program. Professionals working in clinical settings will be trained to teach “Mindfulness for Life” (MBCT-L) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression (MBCT-D), while non-clinical professionals will be able to teach “Finding Peace in a Frantic World” and MBCT-L. It is suitable for those intending to teach mindfulness to adults in general population contexts, workplaces, and educational settings, and for healthcare and mental health professionals planning to teach adults in clinical settings. Associates will be able to utilize their new skillset upon completion, that can be applied towards the community as assistance, or as mindfulness as a focus for mental health and life.

            <h1 class="h2 py-5 text-primary typo-space-line">PCN Project</h1>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The Primary Care Network Initiative is a collaboration program between Alberta Mindfulness Association and Alberta Health Services, that began March in 2021. We are currently in a year-long partnership to develop mindfulness-based programs that promote mental health wellness in Alberta. It is scheduled to begin in January 2022, and consists of Zoom taught MBCT mindfulness sessions, once a week for 8-weeks with licensed and accredited facilitators. Students and practitioners can expect slow, subtle changes in their cognitive processes and way of thinking throughout the 8-weeks of training.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The focus of Mindfulness is the shifting of thoughts away from preoccupations, and redirecting the mind towards the present moment. At Alberta Mindfulness Association, our goal is to create, educate and instill environments that improve well-being, therefore contributing to a higher life satisfaction. Being mindful cultivates a space that allows the mind to savour, assess and appreciate moments in life as they occur, and encourages the individual to fully engage in activities to create a greater capacity to deal with adverse or unpleasant events when they come. By focusing on the present, many people who practice mindfulness find that they are less likely to worry about the future, regret the past and are less preoccupied with concerns about success and self-esteem, thus creating longer and deeper connections with themselves as well as others. Long-term practitioners of Mindfulness have reported significant psychological and somatic improvements in mental health, healthier eating habits, reduction of social conflicts and anxiety in public settings. Additionally, studies have shown that mindfulness can produce positive physical effects such as relieving stress, treating heart disease, lower blood pressure, reduce sleep and mitigate effects of chronic pain.
