            <h1 class="h2 py-5 text-primary typo-space-line">By-Laws</h1>
            <h2 style="text-align: center; ">Membership</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Membership fee, if any, in the Society shall be determined, from time to time, by the members at a general meeting. Any person residing in Alberta and being of the full age of 18 years, may become a member by a favourable vote passed by a majority of the members at a regular meeting of the society, and upon payment of the fee. Such voting shall be by ballot, unless the meeting by resolution otherwise decides. Any person under the age of 18 years may in the same manner become a member upon payment of half of the said fee. A candidate willing to subscribe to the by-laws may join the Society with a paid annual membership fee and approval by the Board of Directors. A candidate should submit an Application Form with fee payment. The application will be reviewed and ruled by the Board of Directors.</li>
                <li>The annual membership fee is due at time of application submittal or on or before June 1 of the year.  A membership is considered as a family.  A single member is entitled to bring a friend or a companion to the activities.</li>
                <li>Any member wishing to withdraw from membership may do so upon a notice in writing or by email to the Board of Directors through its Secretary. If any member is in arrears for fees or assessments for any year, such member shall be automatically suspended at the expiration of six months from the end of such year and thereafter shall not be entitled to membership privileges or powers in the Society until reinstated. Any member upon a majority vote of all members of the Society in good standing may be expelled from membership for any cause which the Society may deem reasonable.</li>
                <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5%;">Board of Directors</h2>
                <li>"Board of Directors", "Executive Committee" or "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Society.</li>
                <li>The Board shall, subject to the by-laws or directions given it by majority vote at any meeting properly called and constituted, have full control and management of the affairs of the Society. Meetings of the Board shall be held as often as may be required, but at least once every three months, and shall be called by the President. A special meeting may be called on the instructions of any two members provided they request the President in writing to call such meeting, and state the business to be brought before the meeting. Meetings of the Board shall be called by 10 days notice in writing mailed to each member or by three days notice by fax, email or telephone. 2/3 of the appointed directors shall constitute a quorum, and meetings shall be held without notice if a quorum of the Board is present, provided however, that any business transactions at such meeting shall be ratified at the next regularly called meeting of the Board; otherwise they shall be null and void.</li>
                <li>The directors may from time to time appoint one or more of their body to the office of managing director or manager or any other for such term and at such remuneration, whether by way of salary, fee, commission, or otherwise, as they may think fit, but his/her appointment shall be subject to determination at the pleasure of the directors. </li>
                <li>A person appointed or elected as a director by the Board becomes a director if they were present at the meeting of the Board of Directors when being appointed or elected, and did not refuse the appointment. They may also become a director if they were not present at the meeting but consented in writing to act a director before the appointment or election, or within ten days after the appointment or election, or if they acted as a director pursuant to the appointment or election.</li>
                <li>Any director or officer upon a majority vote of all members in good standing may be removed from office for any cause which the Society may deem reasonable.</li>
                <li>The directors shall duly comply with the provisions of the Society Act, or any statutory modification thereof for the time being in force, and in particular with the provisions in regard to the registration of mortgages and to keeping registers of directors and members and to mailing of forms or proxy and information circulars, and to filling with the Alberta Registrar an annual report, and copies of special and other resolutions, and of any change in the registered office or of directors.</li>
                <li>The directors shall cause minutes to be made in books provided for the purpose of all appointments of officers made by the directors, of the names of the directors present at each meeting of the directors and of any committee of the directors, of all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Society, and of the directors, and of committees of directors. A director shall be appointed to assume the responsibility to prepare the minutes of the meeting and the meeting minutes shall be kept in the Society’s records maintained by the Secretary.</li>
                <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5%;">President</h2>
                <li>The President shall be ex-officio a member of all Committees. The President shall, when present, preside at all meetings of the Society and of the Board. In the President’s absence, the Vice President shall preside at any such meetings. In the absence of both, a chairperson may be elected at the meeting to preside. The President, during his/her presidency, is the sole representative of the Society and is responsible to the Board of Directors. The President has the authority to represent the Society and the power to authorize a director or a member to represent the Society to deal with external affairs. Nobody should make any official dealings on external affairs without the President’s acknowledgment and authorization. The President or his/her representative(s) shall not make any decisions on the issues directly related to the Society and its interests, unless is specifically authorized, either by the Board of Directors and/or any general or special meeting.

The fiscal year end of the Society in each year shall be December 31.</li>
                <li>The books and records of the Society may be inspected by any member of the Society at the annual meeting or at any time upon giving reasonable notice and arranging a time satisfactory to the officer or officers having charge of same.
